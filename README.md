# End to End Iris Classification with Flask API and Docker

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an end-to-end machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers using a Flask API and deploys it using Docker. It includes:

Data preprocessing and model training
Loading and exploring the Iris dataset
Preprocessing data for model training
Building and training a machine learning model (specify the algorithm used)
Evaluating model performance
Flask API development
Creating a Flask API endpoint for handling prediction requests
Integrating the trained model into the API
Implementing input validation and error handling
Docker deployment
Creating a Dockerfile to containerize the API
Building a Docker image
Running the containerized API

## Additional Information
Dataset: The Iris dataset is included in the repository.
Model: The trained model is saved as model.pkl.
API Documentation: Explore the Flask app code for more details on the API endpoints and implementation.
